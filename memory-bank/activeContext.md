# Stockbright Active Context

## Current Focus: Inventory Update and Management

**German Goal**: "Lager: Aktualisieren, Inventur"  
**Translation**: Stock/Inventory: Update, Inventory Management

## Current Project State

### What We're Working On
Stefan has requested work on **inventory updating and inventory management** for the Stockbright family household inventory app.

### Immediate Context
- Project is in specification/documentation phase
- CSV import/export functionality fully specified
- Sample data available (56 inventory items)
- No existing codebase - needs implementation

### Key Discovery
The project currently exists as:
- **Complete specifications** in `docs/` folder
- **Detailed acceptance tests** with test data
- **Interface documentation** between systems
- **No actual code implementation yet**

## Recent Understanding

### Project Origins
- App name "Stockbright" chosen through systematic naming process
- Combines "Stock" (inventory) + "bright" (smart/intelligent)
- Target mission: "Manage household inventory and plan your shopping. Never forget anything again."

### Technical Foundation
- **CSV Format**: UTF-8 with semicolon separators
- **Sample Data**: 56 items across 6 storage locations
- **Performance Target**: 500 items, 60 locations, <15 seconds import
- **Error Handling**: Skip invalid records, process valid ones

### Current Sample Data Insights
From the inventory export CSV, the system handles:
- **Storage Locations**: Vorratsregal, Eckschrank, Gefrierschrank, Küche, Büro, Ölkeller
- **Item Types**: Food items, ingredients, household supplies
- **Packaging Units**: All standardized units represented
- **Data Patterns**: Mix of items with/without reorder levels

## Next Steps Based on "Lager: Aktualisieren, Inventur"

### Interpretation of Request
The German phrase suggests we need to work on:
1. **Lager Aktualisieren** (Update Inventory/Stock)
   - Modify existing inventory data
   - Update stock quantities
   - Add/remove items

2. **Inventur** (Inventory Management/Stocktaking)
   - Review current stock levels
   - Verify inventory accuracy
   - Generate inventory reports

### Immediate Action Options
Since there's no code yet, we need to clarify what Stefan wants to focus on:
1. **Implement the CSV import functionality** to enable inventory updates
2. **Create inventory management features** for stocktaking
3. **Develop the core application** with update capabilities
4. **Work with existing data files** to demonstrate concepts

### Strategic Considerations
- The project has excellent documentation but needs implementation
- CSV functionality appears to be the foundation for all inventory operations
- Mobile app development would require platform/technology decisions
- Could start with a prototype or proof-of-concept

## Current Decision Point
We need to clarify with Stefan:
- Does he want to implement the mobile app now?
- Focus on CSV processing functionality first?
- Work on inventory management concepts/design?
- Start with a specific aspect of "Lager: Aktualisieren, Inventur"?
